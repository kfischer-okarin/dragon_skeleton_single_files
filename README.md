# Dragon Skeleton (Single File Versions)

This is a repository containing single file versions of the separate parts of my DragonSkeleton middlewares.
See [the main repository](https://github.com/kfischer-okarin/dragon_skeleton).

Since DragonRuby 4.11 you can download it directly with the engine using:

```rb
$gtk.download_stb_rb 'kfischer-okarin', 'dragon_skeleton_single_files', 'long_calculation.rb' # or any other file
```
